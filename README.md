Instacart, an online grocery store operating through an app, aims to uncover valuable insights into their sales patterns. Key objectives include:

- Identifying the busiest days and hours for scheduling ads.
- Determining peak spending times for targeted product advertisements.
- Simplifying price range groupings for effective marketing strategies.
- Analyzing product popularity across departments.
- Understanding customer segmentation and ordering behaviors based on loyalty, region, demographics, etc.

## Key Questions
- What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
- When do customers tend to spend the most money?
- How can product price ranges be simplified for marketing efforts?
- Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders?
- How do customer demographics influence ordering habits?
  
## Data
The project utilizes the following datasets:
- `orders`
- `orders_products_prior`
- `products`
- `customers`
- `departments`

Note: Additional columns such as `prices` were added to the dataset for learning purposes.

## Tools
The analysis is conducted using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas: for data analysis
- Numpy: for mathematical equations
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: for data visualizations
- SciPy: for mathematical equations

## Folders
Project files are organized into the following structure:
- `01 Project Management`: Project Brief & Data Dictionary
- `02 Data`: Original and Prepared Data
- `03 Scripts`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- `04 Analysis`: Reports and Visualizations
- `05 Sent to Client`: Final report presented in Excel

## Resources
- Instacart's data (fictionalized for analysis purposes) is sourced online.
- Project brief contents are fabricated for the purpose of analysis.
